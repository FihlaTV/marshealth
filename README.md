## Synopsis

This is a basic test of our Medical Mobile App which for now is called "Test Project".
For the moment it currently has a very simple interface which involves one Activity called "Main Activity".
This Activity contains two EditText Views for Name and Major, one "Spinner" (which basically is a dropdown menu), a Send Button and a TextView wrapped in a ScrollView in order to be able to scroll the information.

A few important things to do before making this work:

Download MAMP, WAMP, LAMP, XAMP or any web service of your choice.
Download the php-crud-api specifically the "api.php" file and put it in the root of your web directory
